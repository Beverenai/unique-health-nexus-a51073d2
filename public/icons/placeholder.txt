These are placeholder files. In a real app, you would replace these with actual icon files.
For a production app, generate icons of the following sizes:
- 72x72
- 96x96
- 128x128
- 144x144
- 152x152
- 192x192
- 384x384
- 512x512
- apple-touch-icon.png (180x180)

Note: The app is currently using the uploaded image directly as the icon for all sizes.
